#### Reasons for popularity


    MySQL is an open-source database, so you don't have to pay a single penny to use it.
    MySQL is a very powerful program that can handle a large set of functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
    MySQL is customizable because it is an open-source database, and the open-source GPL license facilitates programmers to modify the SQL software according to their own specific environment.
    MySQL is quicker than other databases, so it can work well even with the large data set.
    MySQL supports many operating systems with many languages like PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.
    MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.
    MySQL is very friendly with PHP, the most popular language for web development.
    MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).

#### MySQL Data Types
  Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

  An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to       understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

  In MySQL there are three main data types: **string**, **numeric**, and **date and time**.

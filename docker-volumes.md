## Docker volumes:

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for **persisting data** generated by and used by **Docker containers**. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

Docker has two options for containers to store files in the host machine so that the files are persisted even after the container stops:

   1. **Volumes** are stored in a part of the host filesystem, which is managed by (Ex: local directory)
   2. **Bind mounts** may be stored anywhere on the host system.(Ex: database)

## Create and manage volumes

**Create a volume:**
```bash 
docker volume create (volume name)
```
**List volumes:**
```bash 
docker volume ls
```
**Inspect a volume:**
```bash 
docker volume inspect (volume name)
```
**Remove a volume:**
```bash 
 docker volume rm (volume name)
```

## Start a container with a volume
---
**--mount**
```bash 
 docker run -d \
  --name containerName \
  --mount source=volumeName,target=targetPath \
  imageName
```
**-v**
```bash
 docker run -d \
  --name containerName \
  -v directoryPath:targetPath \
imageName
```
